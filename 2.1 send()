>>>send(IP(dst="192.168.1.254")/ICMP()/"HelloWorld")
.
Sent 1 packets.

send() - sends a SINGLE packet
IP - the type of packet
(dst="192.168.1.254") - the destination of the packet (router)
/ICMP() - ICMP packet is selected with default values from Scapy
/"HelloWorld" - payload to include in the ICMP packet

This basically sends a ICMP (used for error messages) packet to the router.
Putting "type=0" in the ICMP brackets sends a ping reply (others can be found at the end of the book)
